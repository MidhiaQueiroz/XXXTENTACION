                <p class="main-info">XXXTENTACION, also known as Jahseh Dwayne Ricardo Onfory, was an American rapper, singer,
                  and songwriter. Jahseh was born in Plantation, Florida, United States, on January 23, 1998. Jahseh was
                  fatally shot on June 18, 2018 in Deerfield Beach, Florida, while shopping at a motorcycle dealership. He was
                  in his vehicle leaving the dealership, when a black van stopped in front of his car and two men exited with
                  weapons and proceeded to rob and murder Jahseh.</p>

                <h2 class="main-title">Growing up</h2>
                <p class="main-info">Jahseh grew up in a small city in Florida called Broward County. His interest in music
                  began early in his teen years, at around 13 years old. Because of the divorce with his parents when he was
                  about 2 years of age, Jahseh was always a troubled kid. He got into a lot of trouble while attending school,
                  due to fights and trouble with teachers. He also got into trouble with the law a few times, due to robbery,
                  drugs, etc. This ended up getting him into a Juvenile Detention Center, where he met friend and rapper Ski
                  Mask the Slump God. Jahseh dropped out of high school to pursue his music career, along side Ski Mask.</p>

                <h2 class="main-title">Diversity of Music</h2>
                <p class="main-info">Jahseh was an extremely diverse artist, he was able to produce hip-hop, pop, rock, R&amp;B
                  etc. He was heavily referred to as a rapper, though he demonstrated through his projects that he was capable
                  of many genres. An example of a project that showed these capabilities, is his 2018 album "?" which included
                  18 tracks. From start to finish the album showed tracks of all types of genres. On the other hand, the album
                  "17", released August 2017, was a slowed down album showing the more emotional side of Jahseh.</p>

                <h2 class="main-title">Projects/Albums</h2>
                <p class="main-info">As mentioned previously, Jahseh was an extremely diverse artist. Going all the way back
                  to 2013, Jahseh released a project called "Mona Lisa" on <a href="https://soundcloud.com/">SoundCloud</a>,
                  which is where all his music was posted. Jahseh's first major project was released in May 2017, called
                  "Revenge". This was essentially a mixtape with 7 tracks, most of which was already released onto his
                  SoundCloud. Not long after an album was released including Jahseh and Members Only (friends of XXXTENTACION)
                  called Members Only Vol. 3 (MOV3). Then, "17" was released in summer 2017, which gained a lot of attraction
                  because of how different the project was from his previous work. "?" was released in March 2018, also
                  attaining much attraction because of the diversity of the album. Also, Jahseh was a lot more known around
                  this time which played into the amount of attraction and listens the album "?" received. This unfortunately
                  was the last piece of work released before Jahseh passed away in June 2018. A couple other projects were
                  released after his death, such as "Skins" (2018), and "Bad Vibes Forever" (2019).</p>
